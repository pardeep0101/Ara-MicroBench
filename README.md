# Ara-MicroBench
Making a Micro Regulated Benchmark for the Ara project.


Project Overview
The objective of the project is to characterize resource usage in the spiral 3 prototype,
specifically by quantifying resource usage while executing workloads typical for
smartphones. The characterized is based in terms of performance and battery life.
Besides working with the spiral 3, the characterization will also include a baseline: nonmodular
smartphone (currently we have a Nexus S, a Motorola Moto X and a Samsung
Galaxy S6), which will be used for comparison purposes.
Milestones and Advances:
The project has been divided in three phases: 
Training on Performance evaluation and development of microbenchmarks.
System evaluation using microbenchmarks.
Evaluation using real Android applications.

Activities :
3. Micro-benchmark development
a. Extracted power profile provided by vendor, and use it to validate our
findings
b. CPU intensive micro benchmark (similar to Dhrystone) implemented,
working on the memory, I/O storage parts.
4. Characterization with other available Android benchmarks (antutu, eembc, etc)
a. Collect performance data
b. Collect power consumption using power meters and compare it with power
data provided through the Android API.
5. Identifying effective ways to characterize screen and antennas.
